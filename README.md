# CTF-Walkthroughs
A repository for walkthrougs of various CTFs and cybersecurity challenges I have completed. 

One of the most important aspects of cybersecurity is the reporting process during and after an engagement. Revealing a vulnerability that is exploitable is only half of the job. Being able to replicate the exploit, explain exactly what you did, and give recommendations to the stakeholders is the other half. To this end, I am creating this repository to demonstrate my ability to not only complete CTFs, but to be able to communicate the results.
